## Recommendations (Based on Updated Analysis)

### 1-Week Vacation
- **Only Feasible Option**: Air Travel.
- **Recommendation**: Since it's the only choice, focus on minimizing impact: choose airlines with better fuel efficiency if possible, offset emissions, use local transport, and choose sustainable accommodation.

### 1-Month Vacation
- **Lowest Carbon Footprint**: Land & Sea (~413.5 kg CO2e round trip).
- **Lowest Carbon per Day**: Land & Sea (~25.8 kg CO2e/day).
- **Cheapest Option (Hostel)**: Mixed Transport (€1620).
- **Recommendation**: For the most eco-friendly trip, **Land & Sea** is the best choice, offering the lowest overall carbon and lowest carbon per day spent at the destination. It's slightly more expensive than Mixed Transport with a hostel but provides more days at the destination. Mixed Transport is a close second environmentally and slightly cheaper.
- **Considerations**: Both overland routes are significantly longer and more complex than flying, requiring careful planning and consideration of visas, safety, and comfort.

## Justification & Sources (Updated)

- Carbon calculations: Based on updated average emissions per passenger-kilometer (gCO2e/pkm):
  - Plane: 250 (Long-haul average)
  - Train: 35 (European electric average)
  - Bus: 25 (Coach bus average)
  - Ship: 18 (Passenger ferry estimate)
  - *Sources: ADEME (France), UK Gov GHG Factors, ITF reports (See `src/app/data/constants.py` for details)*

- Cost estimates: Rough estimates based on online searches (mid-2024) for transport and accommodation (Booking.com, Hostelworld, Airbnb).

- Distances & Times: Estimated using mapping tools and realistic travel patterns (See `src/app/data/constants.py`).

- Visualizations: Generated by the script and saved in `results/visualizations/`.

## Conclusion (Updated)

- **1-Week Vacation**: Flying remains the only feasible option due to time constraints. Efforts should focus on mitigating its impact.

- **1-Month Vacation**: Overland routes (Land & Sea, Mixed Transport) are significantly more eco-friendly than flying, reducing carbon emissions by over 80%.
  - **Land & Sea** emerges as the most carbon-efficient option overall and per day at the destination.
  - These routes offer unique travel experiences but require substantially more time and planning.

- **Key Takeaway**: Allowing more travel time unlocks drastically lower-carbon travel options. The trade-off involves cost, comfort, and complexity.
